__Discussion questions:
1. What are the naming requirements for variables in your language?
1. What about naming conventions? Are they enforced by the compiler/interpreter, or are they
just standards in the community?
2. Is your language statically or dynamically typed?
3. Strongly typed or weakly typed?
4. If you put this line (or something similar) in a program and try to print x, what does it do? If it
doesn't compile, why? Is there something you can do to make it compile?
x = "5" + 6
5. Describe the limitations (or lack thereof) of your programming language as they relate to the
coding portion of the assignment (adding ints and floats, storing different types in lists, etc).
Are there other restrictions or pitfalls that the documentation mentions that you need to be
aware of?
6. How do type conversions work in your language? Are the conversions narrowing or widening,
and do they work by default or do they have to be declared by the programmer?
